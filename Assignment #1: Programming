Assignment: Programming Review
Q1. 
    3. Do any of your findings surprise you?
      I was surprised that a Data Scientist made more money than an Accountant. I had assumed that Accountants made more
      money because their work is very important and essential. Everyone needs accounting. However, with the rise of 
      AI and the advancement in technologies, I can see why the need for Data Scientists is on the rise. 
    4. From best to worst: Human Resources Manager, Information Security Analysts, Data Scientist, Personal Finance Advisor, 
       Digital Designer, Project Management Specialist, Financial Analyst, Accountant, Lawyer. I chose Human Resources 
      Manager as the best because it pays well and they get to travel, which is something I'm looking for in a job. I 
      chose the next three because they pay well and they seem interesting. The reason I put Digital Designer above 
      Project Management Specialist despite it paying less is because the work seemed more interesting. I put Lawyer last
      despite it paying the most because it seems like it would take a long time to complete and the work itself seems boring. 
Q2. 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parts 1 to 4
x = np.linspace(0,1,50)
y = np.log(x)
z = np.exp(x)
plt.scatter(x,y)
plt.scatter(x,z)
plt.show()

# Parts 6, 7
x = np.linspace(0,1,50)
y = np.log(x)
z = np.exp(x)
plt.scatter(x,y, label ='Natural Log')
plt.scatter(x,z, label='Exponential')
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("Y")
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.title('Natural Log and Exponential Functions')
plt.show()
